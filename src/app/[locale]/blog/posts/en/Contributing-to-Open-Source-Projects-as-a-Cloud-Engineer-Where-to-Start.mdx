When I made my first open-source contribution at 21, I had no idea it would set the stage for my career. I was nervous, unsure if my skills were enough, and hesitant about submitting my first pull request. But the open-source community welcomed me with open arms. That experience taught me two key lessons:

## You don’t need to be an expert to contribute.
Every contribution—no matter how small—makes a difference.
Since then, I’ve never stopped contributing. Fast forward to today, I’m actively involved in OpenStrata, a game-changing project focused on PowerApps Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). Working on OpenStrata has been a journey of innovation, collaboration, and growth, and I want to share how you can get started in open source and make an impact, just like I did.

## Why Open Source?
Open source is at the heart of modern cloud computing, powering tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and Prometheus. For cloud engineers, contributing to open-source projects is more than just a professional milestone—it’s a way to:

1. Learn by Doing: Apply and deepen your skills in real-world projects.
2. Build Credibility: Showcase your contributions on GitHub and beyond.
3. Network with Experts: Collaborate with engineers and developers globally.
4. Make an Impact: Help shape tools and frameworks used worldwide.
I’ve experienced this firsthand while contributing to OpenStrata. It’s thrilling to know that my work is helping organizations streamline PowerApps management, improve deployment pipelines, and enable collaboration across teams.

## How I Got Started
At 21, I found a GitHub project that needed a bug fix. It wasn’t glamorous—I fixed a small issue with file naming conventions—but it was enough to get me started. I forked the repository, cloned it to my local machine, and submitted my first pull request.

It wasn’t perfect. The maintainer pointed out a better approach, and I had to revise my work. But that process taught me the value of feedback and collaboration.

Fast forward to today, my journey has led me to projects like OpenStrata. This initiative is focused on making PowerApps lifecycle management more efficient, scalable, and accessible. Through OpenStrata, I’ve contributed to creating deployment pipelines, defining modular templates, and solving challenges related to cloud-native application development.

Your Strategic Plan to Start Contributing
If you’re ready to dive into open source, here’s a step-by-step guide tailored to cloud engineers:

### Step 1: Align Your Goals and Interests
Start by identifying what excites you:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation.
- Containerization: Kubernetes, Docker, or OpenShift.
- Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, or Loki.
- Cloud-Specific Projects: AWS SDKs, Azure DevOps tools, or GCP libraries.

Example: My passion for automating cloud workflows led me to OpenStrata, where I get to improve PowerApps ALM pipelines and tackle real-world deployment challenges.

### Step 2: Find the Right Projects
Explore platforms and communities to discover open-source opportunities:

## GitHub/GitLab:

Search for tags like good first issue or help wanted.

Example: OpenStrata offers issues related to deployment templates and ALM improvements.

## CNCF Projects:

Kubernetes, Helm, Prometheus, and other cloud-native tools.

## Specialized Projects:

For IaC enthusiasts, Terraform modules are always in demand.
For container experts, Docker images or Kubernetes manifests need continuous improvement.

### Step 3: Prepare Before Contributing

### Learn the Basics:

- Git workflows: Forking, branching, and creating pull requests.
- Linux commands: Essential for navigating server environments.
- Cloud skills: Familiarize yourself with Terraform, Docker, or Kubernetes.

### Set Up the Project Locally:

Fork and clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/cloucwfranck/project.git
cd project

Run the project locally. For OpenStrata, you might use Docker to test PowerApps deployments or simulate CI/CD pipelines.

### Start Small:

- Fix documentation errors or typos.
- Write test cases for uncovered code.
- Address simple bugs.

### Step 4: Tackle Intermediate Contributions
Once comfortable, move on to technical tasks:

- Build CI/CD Pipelines: Automate deployment workflows.
- Enhance IaC Templates: Write Terraform modules or Ansible playbooks.
- Optimize Containerization: Improve Dockerfiles or Kubernetes Helm charts.

For example, in OpenStrata, I’ve worked on creating reusable deployment templates that simplify the setup process for PowerApps environments.

### Step 5: Collaborate with the Community
Open source thrives on collaboration. Engage by:

- Joining forums, Slack channels, or mailing lists.
- Participating in discussions on GitHub issues.
- Providing code reviews for others’ pull requests.
During my work with OpenStrata, brainstorming sessions with other contributors often sparked solutions I hadn’t considered.

### Step 6: Showcase Your Work
Document your contributions to amplify their impact:

- Write blog posts detailing your experience.
- Share your pull requests and commits on LinkedIn or GitHub.
- Use your portfolio to highlight key projects, like OpenStrata, where you’ve made a difference.

## Challenges and How to Overcome Them
- Complex Codebases: Focus on small, manageable tasks to build confidence.
- Time Management: Dedicate a few hours weekly to contributing.
- Feedback and Revisions: Embrace critiques as opportunities to improve.

### Conclusion: Your Open-Source Journey Starts Here
Contributing to open source has been one of the most rewarding parts of my journey as a cloud engineer. From my first pull request to my work on OpenStrata, every step has taught me something new and connected me with incredible people.

You don’t need to wait until you feel "ready." Start small, stay consistent, and remember that your contributions—no matter how minor—help build the tools shaping the future of cloud computing.
