Creating my personal website, CloudCraft with Franck, was one of the most fulfilling projects I’ve undertaken as a cloud engineer. It’s my platform to showcase my work, write blogs, publish case studies, and share insights with the cloud engineering community. And the best part? I built and deployed it using free tools and resources, which made the journey both rewarding and cost-effective.

In this article, I’ll share how I built my website step by step, the tools I used, and lessons learned along the way.

## Why I Built CloudCraft with Franck

### I wanted a centralized space to:

- Showcase My Work: Highlight personal projects, case studies, and contributions to open source.
- Write Blogs: Share technical insights, solutions to challenges, and best practices for cloud engineering.
- Engage with the Community: Build credibility and connect with others in the tech industry.

## How I Built the Website
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how I created my website:

### 1. Planning the Project
Before writing a single line of code, I focused on planning:

- Content: What sections the website should include (blogs, projects, case studies).
- Tools: I decided on Next.js as the framework, GitHub for version control, Vercel for hosting, and Canva for visuals.
- Structure: I designed the repository structure to keep things organized and scalable (refer to the screenshot for details).

### 2. Setting Up the Development Environment
Since I was working on a Windows machine, I relied on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to streamline development:

Installed Node.js and npm within WSL for managing dependencies.
Used Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my IDE to write and manage the project’s codebase.
Connected GitHub for version control, enabling seamless commits and pushes.

### 3. Using Next.js for the Website
I chose Next.js because it’s a powerful framework for building React-based applications, and it integrates well with modern tools like Vercel. Here's how I structured the project:

### Repository Structure

- /src/app: Contains core components like layout and page templates.
- /blog/posts: Articles are written in .mdx format for Markdown with React components. This allows dynamic, interactive blog content.
- /resources: Stores configuration files (e.g., sitemap.ts, robots.ts).
- /components: Houses reusable components for layouts, buttons, and other UI elements.
- /public: Includes static assets like images and icons.

### Key Features
Dynamic Routing: Next.js allowed me to create dynamic blog post pages based on .mdx files stored in blog/posts.
Static Site Generation (SSG): Ensured fast load times by pre-rendering pages during build time.

### 4. Writing Articles with MDX
I leveraged .mdx files to write and publish my articles. Why MDX?

Combines Markdown simplicity with the power of React components.
Allows embedding custom elements like charts or interactive code snippets directly in blog posts.
For example, articles like “Troubleshooting Kubernetes Cluster Issues” and “Ansible Tips for AWS” were written in MDX, and the structure made it easy to manage content.

### 5. Designing Visuals with Canva
To enhance the website’s aesthetic and make the blogs visually appealing, I used Canva to create images, graphics, and banners. Canva is user-friendly and, most importantly, free!

Tip for Graphics
Keep visuals consistent with your site’s theme.
Use clean, professional designs to make the content more engaging.

### 6. Hosting and Deployment with Vercel
I deployed the website on Vercel, which offers free hosting for personal projects. Vercel is a perfect match for Next.js because it simplifies deployment with a one-click setup.

Deployment Process
- Pushed my code to GitHub.
- Connected the GitHub repository to Vercel.
Every time I pushed new changes to the main branch, Vercel automatically built and deployed the site.

### 7. Staying Organized
One of the most critical lessons I learned during this project was the importance of staying organized:

Focus on One Task at a Time: I started with the blog section before adding case studies or gallery features.
Keep Your Repository Structured: The clean folder structure helped me manage components, posts, and resources efficiently.
Use Version Control: I committed small changes often to avoid losing progress.

### 8. Learning from the Community
Throughout this project, I leaned heavily on the open-source community. When I faced challenges:

- I searched for answers on GitHub Discussions, Stack Overflow, and the Next.js documentation.
- I asked for help and collaborated with others who had faced similar issues.
Remember, no one builds alone—there’s always someone willing to help!

### What I Learned from the Process
- Start Small: Begin with a single feature or page, then expand as your confidence grows.
- Iterate: Your first version doesn’t have to be perfect. Get it running, then refine.
- Leverage Free Tools: From Canva to Vercel, there are many free resources to build a professional-quality site.
- Stay Consistent: Regular updates and maintenance keep the site fresh and relevant.

Features of CloudCraft with Franck

Today, my website serves as:

- A Blog Hub: Articles written in MDX cover topics like Kubernetes, Ansible, and cloud-native tools.
- A Portfolio: Showcases my case studies, open-source contributions, and professional projects.
- A Resource for Others: I aim to inspire and help others by sharing insights, solutions, and lessons learned.

## Conclusion
Building CloudCraft with Franck was more than just a technical exercise—it was a creative journey that allowed me to combine my skills, passion, and a love for sharing knowledge. Whether you’re a cloud engineer or aspiring developer, creating a personal website is one of the best ways to showcase your work, build credibility, and engage with the tech community.
